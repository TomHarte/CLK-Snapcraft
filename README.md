# CLK-Snapcraft

This repository hosts the Snap integration of [Clock Signal](https://github.com/tomharte/CLK)'s Qt port.

This is a separate repository for possibly specious resons:
* it will allow me to version Snapcraft releases separately, reducing noise if updates do not affect the Qt build; and
* in any case, I'm neither confident nor skilled at Linux desktop deployment and the separation helps with comfort.
